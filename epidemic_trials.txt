To use system commands (ls, cd, pwd ...) in class:
>> $ls
>> $pwd



------------------
Start/exit class:
------------------
>> class
>> exit

(weeds works within class, i.e. to use weeds, start class and use weeds commands inside class)

------------------
Get help on a command:
------------------
>> help plot

------------------
Select and show a spectrum (a spectrum is a file named "name_spectrum.alma"):
------------------
>> file in name_specrtum.alma
>> find
Needed to find all subfiles within the name_spectrum.alma file
>> list
List all the subfiles
>> get f
>> plot
>> get n
>> plot

------------------
Enable cursor to get local information on the spectrum:
------------------
>> draw
The position where you click on the graphic window gives you the frequency ('rest frequency'),velocity, intensity (Antenna Temperature) and so on.

------------------
Make a zoom on the spectrum:
------------------
>> let mode x
>> let mode y
>> plot
------------------
Come back to full spectrum
------------------
>> let mode x tot
>> let mode y tot
>> plot

------------------
Measure noise level in the spectrum:
------------------
>> set window
Enables interactive cursors to setup window(s) to be avoided for noise level calculation
>> draw window
Shows the previously defined window(s)
>> base 0 /plot
Subtracts from the current spectrum a polynomial baseline of degree 0
>> plot
--> print the result on the terminal, the noise level is given by 'rms', in units of the current spectrum (i.e. in K if the spectrum is in K, in Jy/beam otherwise)

------------------
Fit gaussian to a line:
------------------
+ First make a zoom around the line you are interested in
+ get the line peak frequency using the 'draw' command
>> modify frequency 'XXXXX'
Re-center the line at the correct frequency
>> set unit v f
Change the x-axis to velocity (use 'set unit f v' if you want to come back to frequency axis)
>> set window
>> base 0 /pl
>> plot
>> method gauss
>> lines 1
Enable cursor to select the edge of the line you want to fit
>> minimize
Does the gaussian fit and outputs results on the terminal
>> visu
Plot the resulting gaussian


------------------
Change the color of your pen
------------------
>> pen /col black 
>> pen /col red
... (basically same color names as in python)



------------------
Memorize a spectrum and plot it on top of another one
------------------
>> memorize SPEC1
Memorize a spectrum with name SPEC1
>> retrieve SPEC1
>> spec
Plot a spectrum on top of another one. Before, make sure x and y axes are identifcal for both spectra you want to compare, using set mode x and set mode y 







--------------------
-- WEEDS commands --
--------------------
>> use in cdms
Use the online cdms database to find lines
>> lid /species "CH3OH, vt=0-2" /full
Show all methanol lines in the current frequency window
>> lid /species "CH3OH, vt=0-2" /full /energy 900 /aij 1e-5
Show all lines from methanol with Energy level > 900 and Aij coefficient > 1e-5
