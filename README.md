# Simple-Stochastic-Epidemic-Simulator-C-C-
This project was done for a C/C++ course in the Fall of 2021 at the University of Virginia.  

This program simulates the spread of an infectious disease in a closed population using a simple agent-based model. Each trial runs a 100-day outbreak over 10,000 people with vaccination, transmission, recovery, and death modeled probabilistically. It reports per-trial totals and the average/standard deviation of deaths across trials.
